I'm a college student and that means I'm just getting used to this "making meals for myself" thing. I keep getting messages from my mother telling me that I've spent too much money on food, because to be quite honest, I really do. I shouldn't be buying a meal or two every day, and it takes about as long to make a good meal as it does to go out, buy one, and wait for it to be prepared. The problem, I find, is that I just don't know what my options are. Cooking a decent meal isn't really challenging if you have the recipe, so I've decided to compile a list of "college meals" based on the time they take to prepare and the ingredients they require, as well as the tools one needs to make them. This will help me decide what I can make with what I have in a pinch, and will also motivate me to be creative with my meals. Bear in mind that almost none of these will be "from scratch," because I don't have time for that. All the documented times are from the moment I started gathering materials to when I sat down to eat (this includes washing dishes, so it slightly penalizes recipes with a lot of dishes). Without further ado:

Spaghetti and Meatballs:
    time:
        30 mins
    ingredients:
        1 big ass bag of frozen meatballs
        a handful of spaghettis
        some sauce
        cheese and olive oil (if you're feeling fancy)
    tools:
        2 saucepans
        2 wooden spoons
    instructions:
        fill a pan with 2/3 water, salt it, and start boiling it
        pour 2 cups of sauce and a bunch of meatballs in pan and start heating on medium heat
        stir for a little while then turn down the heat and cover it
        when water pan starts boiling, put all the spaghetti in
        stir spaghetti occasionally until it feels/tastes done
        drain water with fork or collander
        plate the pasta, sauce, and (opt) top with cheese and olive oil
    deliciousness:
        pretty good

Corned Beef Hash and Eggs:
    time:
        20 mins
    ingredients:
        can of corned beef hash
        2 eggs
    tools:
        1 frying pan
        rubber spatula
    instructions:
        open the can of hash and dump it all out on the pan
        Break it up and flatten it out over the entire pan
        Place over stovetop on medium heat. Watch and flip/stir regularly
        Once the hash is getting kind of crispy, pour it all out on your plate
        Crack two eggs into the pan and cook over medium so there's a little bit of run to the yolk
        Put eggs on the hash, add some salt/pepper, and eat!

Tuna Burritos:
    time:
        25 mins for two
    ingredients:
        can of tuna
        can of beans
        shredded cheese
        salsa
        2 tortillas
    tools:
        fork
        frying pan
        spatula
    instructions:
        put half the can of tuna in the tortilla and break it up until its evenly mashed
        pour enough beans to cover the tuna
        pour enough cheese to cover the beans
        add a dollop of salsa
        fold up the burrito and put it on the frying pan on low heat
        If you're making more than one, prepare the other now
        once the bottom of the first burrito starts to brown, flip it
        give each side about 5 minutes at low heat (if it's too hot it will burn fast)
        once its done, swap out for the other burrito and finish cooking that one
        enjoy!
