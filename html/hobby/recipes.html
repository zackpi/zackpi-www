I'm a college student and that means I'm just getting used to this "making meals for myself" thing. I keep getting messages from my mother telling me that I've spent too much money on food, because to be quite honest, I really do. I shouldn't be buying a meal or two every day, and it takes about as long to make a good meal as it does to go out, buy one, and wait for it to be prepared. The problem, I find, is that I just don't know what my options are. Cooking a decent meal isn't really challenging if you have the recipe, so I've decided to compile a list of "college meals" based on the time they take to prepare and the ingredients they require, as well as the tools one needs to make them. This will help me decide what I can make with what I have in a pinch, and will also motivate me to be creative with my meals. Bear in mind that almost none of these will be "from scratch," because I don't have time for that. All the documented times are from the moment I started gathering materials to when I sat down to eat (this includes washing dishes, so it slightly penalizes recipes with a lot of dishes). Without further ado:

Spaghetti and Meatballs:
    time:
        33 mins
    ingredients:
        1 big ass bag of frozen meatballs
        a handful of spaghettis
        some sauce
        cheese and olive oil (if you're feeling fancy)
    tools:
        2 saucepans
        2 wooden spoons
    instructions:
        fill a pan with 2/3 water, salt it, and start boiling it
        pour 2 cups of sauce and a bunch of meatballs in pan and start heating on medium heat
        stir for a little while then turn down the heat and cover it
        when water pan starts boiling, put all the spaghetti in
        stir spaghetti occasionally until it feels/tastes done
        drain water with fork or collander
        plate the pasta, sauce, and (opt) top with cheese and olive oil
    deliciousness:
        pretty good
