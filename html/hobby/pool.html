    Pool is a cool game. It's a combination of strategy and skill and geometry and physics. I wish I had had a pool table when I was a kid, but to be honest I probably would have spent too much time playing it if I did. Anyway, I like playing against myself, which some might say is sad but to me it's pretty much just as fun as playing against someone else. At the fraternity where I'm currently staying for the summer, there's a pool table and an Alexa speaker in the library, so I like to go in there for an hour or so in the mornigna nd shoot some pool while listening to music. After a month of this, I realized I'd come close to shooting a "perfect" game a couple times, but I'd never quite gotten it.</br>
    By perfect, I mean that I got all of the balls in without changing possession or turns. I think a similar term is a runout, but that implies that you're not playing a valid game of pool and that you can hit whichever balls and in whatever order. Another similar one is a 147 or maximum in snooker, in which you clear the entire table in one break. But the perfect game is different because it doesn't have a specific order like a "maxi", but you can't hit the opposite type of ball unlike a runout.</br>
    With those thoughts in mind, I decided to start tracking my progress until I achieve a perfect game, or even until I can get perfect games with some consistency. I might not document every day I play because it relies on my counting while playing, but I'll try to be consistent enough to get a decent amount of data. Here you go!</br>
